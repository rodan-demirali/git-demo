When a humble bard
Graced a ride along
With Geralt of Rivia
Along came this song

From when the White Wolf fought
A silver-tongued devil
His army of elves
At his hooves did they revel

They came after me
With masterful deceit
Broke down my lute
And they kicked in my teeth

While the devil's horns
Minced our tender meat
And so cried the Witcher
He can't be bleat

Toss a coin to your Witcher
Oh, Valley of Plenty
Oh, Valley of Plenty, oh
Toss a coin to your Witcher
Oh, Valley of Plenty
